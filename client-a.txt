# Client Task A #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #

Client (A): The Counting Company. Needs a small relaxing number game.

Random number game (JavaSript):

Step 1-Generating a random number

  1. Using Math.random() function to generate some number between 1 and 10
  2. Multiply the result by the max range you want, here we set it to 50 and we now 
     round it down using the Math.floor() function.  
  3. Store the generated number in a variable.

Step 2-Initialize the variables

     Build variables to hold user's guess, number of attempts and a signal to indicate if
     the game is over.

 
Step 3. Begin game loop (While game is not over signal will be false )
   
   1. Prompt user to enter a guess
   2. Convert user input to a number using parseInt()
   3. if - guess is correct:
      Display a message: "You Won!" also show number of attempts.
      Set the Game over signal to True.
   
    Else: 

     1. If guess is to high: message "Your guess is to high"
     2. If guess is to high: message "Your guess is to low"
     3. Increment number of guesses.

Pseudo Code:

function numberGuessingGame() 
       Generats a random number between 1 and 10
     let randomeNumber = Math.foor  * 10 +1;

       Initialize the variables
     let guess;
     let attempts = 0;

       Start game loop
     while  attepts < 3 
      guess = parseInt prompt "Enter your guess 1-10:" 

        if  guess === randomeNumber  
          console.log "Great work! You guessed the correct number!" + attempts + attempts."
          retun;

        else if guess > randomNumber
        console.log "Sorry that guess is to high";

        else 
        console.log "Sorry that guess is low" ;

        attempts++;

        console.log "Sorry, you have run out guesses. The correct nnumber is " + randomeNumber  ;
