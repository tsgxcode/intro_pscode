# Client Task B #

Warehouse Land INC. Needs to help customers find their way around the facility.

The client's facility is about 100.000 square ft. w/ 2 levels. The customers need a map of the levels, department, bathrooms, isles, etc.

1. Data Structure :
2d "map" contains cells, each holding locations of each level, isles, products, etc.
Coordinates: x and y position on the grid, for finding Aisle, Section, item, etc.
Connecting each using north, south, east, west mapping.

2. Algorithm for paths:
shows the customers the fastest way from their location to the items / place in the warehouse.

3. User Interface:
Graphical display of the customers current location and a very basic visual display of where they want to go.

Pseudo Code:  Python


class Node 
    def __init__ self, x, y, label
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.label = label
        self.connections = 

def bfs start, target :
    queue =  start
    visited = set 
    parent = 

    while queue:
        current = queue.pop 0
        visited.add current

        if current is target:
            path = 
            node = target
            while node is not start
                path.insert 0, node
                node = parent node
            path.insert 0, start
            return path

        for neighbor in current.connections:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append neighbor
                parent neighbor = current

    return None
