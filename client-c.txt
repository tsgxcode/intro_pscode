# Client Task C #

The Organ-iZ-iT Co. Needs a small package counting app




The program counts the number of items a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. 
Each case can only fit 50 product packages. This program should fill the customer's need, as it prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

Pseudocode C# 

Variables:

packageCount - Integer to store the current package count.
caseCount - Integer to store the current case count.


Algorithm:

Initialize packageCount to 2.
Initialize caseCount to 0.
While packageCount is less than or equal to 50:
Print packageCount.
Increment packageCount by 2.
If packageCount is greater than or equal to 50:
Increment caseCount by 1.
Print "New Case Started."
Set packageCount to 2.

int packageCount = 2;
int caseCount = 0;

while packageCount <= 50 
    Console.WriteLine packageCount;
    packageCount += 2;

    if  packageCount >= 50
        caseCount++;
        Console.WriteLine "New Case Started.";
        packageCount = 2;

Console.WriteLine "Total Cases: " + caseCount;
